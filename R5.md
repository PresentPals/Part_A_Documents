### Profile Page

The example provided for the profile page, is for a family, Parent (is the admin) and the child has a profile. We decided to create a family account (like Netflix, Stan, Disney+) as most children will not have an email or social media account, required to login

In this example we have provided the following:
* iPhone: Parent, with child (Maddie) list
