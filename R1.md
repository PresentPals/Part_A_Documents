# Purpose

This project serves a truly impactful purpose by merging environmental sustainability with cost-efficiency. It focuses on three core objectives: protecting the environment, minimizing wasteful spending on unwanted gifts, and streamlining the gift-giving experience for users.

## Functionalities/Features
 - Gift List
 - Countdown to birthday or event
 - Invite Friends


 ## Target Audience
Our platform is designed for families, especially parents, grandparents, and other family members, who want to make gift-giving easier and more meaningful. Parents and grandparents can create accounts, set up profiles for their children (ages 8-17), and start building personalized wishlists. Once the wishlist is ready, the admin user (parent or grandparent) can easily share it with other family members, who can then purchase the perfect gift online directly from the provided links. It’s a simple, eco-friendly way to make sure the right gift is bought while saving time and reducing waste. 


## Key Objectives;
1.	Environmental Impact: By transitioning to a paperless system for gift lists, the project helps reduce paper waste, contributing to environmental sustainability.
2.	Cost-Effective Gift Giving: The system enables users to create personalised and accurate gift lists, minimizing the purchase of unwanted, inappropriate or duplicate gifts. This helps reduce both environmental waste and unnecessary spending.
3.	Streamlining the Gift Selection Process: The platform collects data on user preferences, allowing clients to buy gifts with greater precision. Additionally, users can purchase gifts directly online through provided links, making the process faster and more convenient. By doing so, the system not only saves time and effort but also ensures that the gift is exactly what the recipient wants.

In summary, the project promotes sustainability, saves clients time and money, and offers a seamless shopping experience by linking users directly to online gift options.
