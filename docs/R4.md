# R4 User Stories
In order to ensure that our application would meet the needs and expectations of our users, we made it a priority to gain a comprehensive understanding of what they truly wanted from the platform. To achieve this, we conducted in-depth interviews with a diverse range of individuals across various demographics. These discussions allowed us to gain valuable insights into their preferences, challenges, and the key benefits they would like to see incorporated into the application. By gathering this qualitative data, we were able to carefully define the structure and features of the platform, ensuring that it would not only address the specific needs of our users but also add meaningful value to their lives. This user-centered approach guided the design process, allowing us to create a solution that is both functional and truly impactful for those who use it.
